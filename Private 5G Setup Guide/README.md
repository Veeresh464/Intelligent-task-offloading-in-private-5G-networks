# ðŸ“¡ Private 5G Network Setup

This repository documents the **end-to-end setup** of a real-time 5G network using:

- **Open5GS** as the 5G Core  
- **srsRAN** as the Radio Access Network (RAN)  
- **USRP B210** as the base station hardware  
- Connected to **Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)** 5G devices (smartphones)  

âœ… Fully tested with **Samsung S23** and **OPPO Reno 5G** using **OpenCell SIM cards**.


## ðŸ›  Requirements

| Component       | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** | Operating system for running Open5GS & srsRAN |
| **USRP B210**   | Software-defined radio hardware acting as the 5G base station |
| **OpenCell SIM** | SIM cards for registering UEs with the 5G core |
| **COTS UE**     | 5G smartphones for testing connectivity |

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Install Ubuntu on bare metal (dual boot recommended) instead of using a virtual machine for better hardware performance and less probability of the errors.
