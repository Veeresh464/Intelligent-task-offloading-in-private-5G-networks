# Schedular Edge Node

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1619f0bf-c11a-4342-98ab-c2fdabcf3479)

> 👽🕵️‍♀️ The Schedular is a LSTM based edge node that selects the best edge node (Image classification nodes) and forward requests to it for next 30 seconds.
> Kindly Note: Dont be confused there is only one VM in cloud core (Openstack) in above architecture we have shown two just for proper explaination.

## 1. Deployment file for schedualar

- **Here BACKEND_URLS are the IP address of edge nodes. Check /2.Edge-Application-Deployment.md for BACKEND_URLS**
- **CLOUD_SERVER_URL is IP of VM that we are going to deploy as Backup if no edge nodes are below threshold set according to it**
- **CPU_THRESHOLD: "0.3" (0-1) the range below which edge node can expect requests (30% CPU Utilization here)**
- **MEM_THRESHOLD: "0.3" (0-1) the range below which edge node can expect requests (30% RAM Utilization here)**
- **CHECK_INTERVAL: "30" The Interval after which the schedular should check the status of edge nodes (Every 30 seconds here)**

`vim edge-schedular-deployment.yml`

```

## 2. Service file for schedualar

`vim edge-schedular-service.yml`

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: scheduler-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: scheduler
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5001
      targetPort: 5001
      nodePort: 30084
  type: NodePort

```

## 3. Run deployment and Service file

```
kubectl apply -f edge-schedular-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f edge-schedular-service.yml

```

## 4. Clarification

**Note:**
**From Smartphones connected to the Private 5g networks we only request schedular the schedular autometically forward request to one of the Edge nodes or cloud backup node based on LSTM model prediction**
```
Ex: Schedular is accepting request at 5001 port but we have mapped it to 30084 in service so we request this port
Since it is in  Open5gs VM we can request open5gs Gateway IP and it will be processed by schedular

curl -X POST http://10.45.0.1:30084/predict \
  -F "file=@image.jpg"
Note: Ensure image.jpg is present
```
